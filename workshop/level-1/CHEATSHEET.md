```

## Effective Question Patterns

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Structure | "What files are in this project and what does each one do?" |
| Data flow | "Trace the execution path when I run `python main.py add ...`" |
| Edge cases | "What happens if the JSON file is corrupted?" |
| Comparison | "How does `format_table` differ from `format_csv`?" |
| Dependencies | "Which files import from `config.py`?" |
| Deep dive | "Explain the `format_table` function line by line" |
